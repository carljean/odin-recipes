        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pkg(16oz) spaghetti</li>
            <li>4 - 6 hotdogs</li>
            <li>1 Onion, sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 green pepper, sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 red pepper, sliced</li>
            <li>3 - 4 table spoons, Epis</li>
            <li>1 chicken maggie cube</li>
            <li>1/2 table spoon adobo</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
            <li>â€‹2 tbsps. Vegetable Oil</li>
            <li>2 tbsps. Tomato Paste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Slice the hotdogs into small bite-sized pieces and boil them until they swell up, about 3 - 5 minutes. Then drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti according to package directions. Be sure to salt the water and add about 2 tbsps. of vegetable oil. Before draining the spaghetti and setting it aside, reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta water and crush to dissolve a Maggie chicken boullion cube in it. </li>
            <li>In the same pot used to cook the spaghetti, which is now empty, pour in 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil and 2 tbsps of tomato paste. On medium heat, saute and frequently stir the tomato paste for about 2 - 3 minutes, taking care for it not to burn.</li>
            <li>Add in the hotdogs and epice. Saute for another minute or two, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Add in remaining vegetables: onions, green peppers, and red peppers. Add in your spices: 1/2 tsp. Adobo and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder. You may also add in 1/2 a scotch bonnet or habenero pepper if desired. If you really want it spicy, add in the whole thing... Saute everything, stirring frequently for 2 - 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take the reserved pasta water with dissolved Maggie and add it to the pot. Bring it to a simmer, just enough for the tomato paste to fully dissolve and produce a sauce. After it looks smooth and saucy, about a minute or two, add in the spaghetti and mix thoroughly to fully incorporate. Once the the hotdog and veggie mixture is well combined with the spaghetti, you may now enjoy.</li>
