            What makes Haitian eggs different from any other eggs? Well, not much really. It's just the fact that it tends to be hard fried with golden brown edges. This is another extremely versatile dish where you can use whatever fillings your heart desires as well as the spices. In this particular recipe, I use 6 eggs in order to serve 3 to 4 people. There won't be specific amounts for every ingredient as it will be based on how much you want if you decide to use it. Therefore, you can use this recipe as a guide.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
            <li>3 - 5 tbps Oil</li>
            <li>1/4 - 1/2 tsp Goya Adobo</li>
            <li>Hotdogs, cut up (or any other choice of breakfast meat)</li>
            <li>Bell peppers, thinly sliced or diced (color of your choice)</li>
            <li>Onions, thinly sliced or diced</li>
            <li>Tomatoes, diced</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare all your ingredients and fillings for your eggs. From all your vegetables/herbs to meats (if you decide to use it), have them all diced up and ready to go. If you decide to use a hot pepper (which of course I recommend), thinly slice it and discard the seeds. You may keep some seeds for that extra kick of heat if you so desire. Be sure to wear gloves or wash your hands with soap and water after handling hot peppers.</li>
            <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl. Remove the chalaza (yes, I googled it) from the yolk. My grandmother refers to this as the "germ" (say that in a Haitian accent). It's the whitish thing that usually hangs around the yolk. Most Haitians I know are very adamant about removing that white thing from their eggs.</li>
            <li>Add all the spices of your choice to the eggs (be sure not to over do it). The main one I always add first is the Goya Adobo. If you haven't realized it yet, this is definitly my go-to default spice for almost everything. Aside from the optional spices listed in the ingredient section, other things you may consider are seasoned salt or that traditional Maggie bouillon cube (in this case you would definitly NOT use the entire cube!). With a whisk or fork, beat the eggs until it becomes a uniform consistency. I've also noticed that my grandmother tends to squeeze a little bit of lime juice to whisk into the eggs. She tells me that it gets rid of that "eggy" smell. If we don't happen to have any hot peppers on hand, an additional spice my grandmother adds is cayenne pepper to make up for it.</li>
            <li>In a pan on medium-high to high heat, add in the oil. When it comes up to temperature, add in all of your prepared vegetables/herbs and meats minus the garlic, scallions and hot peper (I like to add these in a couple minutes later to avoid them from burning/over-cooking). Saute the vegetables/herbs/meats for about 3-5 minutes, stirring occassionaly.</li>
            <li>Pour in the beaten eggs. It should sizzle on contact. The eggs may spread the veggies toward the sides so use your utensil to re-spread them evenly.</li>
        </ol>
